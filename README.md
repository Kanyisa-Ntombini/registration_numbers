# Registration Numbers!
Miro: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lA_58bI=/

## What is this webpage about?
* I am creating a webpage that takes in a registration number from an input field. When the add button is pressed the number goes to a list
* The registration plate must have a rounded black border and a silver or yellow background
* It must be deployed to github pages
* Create unit tests

## Part 2

* A drop-down menu must appear in which a town can be selected
* Only one town can be selected at a time
* The registration numbers of the town selected must be shown
* Registration numbers must stay on the page after page refreshes
